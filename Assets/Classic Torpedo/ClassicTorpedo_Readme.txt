Classic Torpedo 

The prefab contains both the visual model and the collision data. The propellors will animate by them selves via the included animation file. The FX bubbles will also activate by themselves. 

You will need to move the torpedo yourself and also create your own explosion FX. No scripts are provided to control the torpedo.


Special thanx to everyone at Dragonhill
